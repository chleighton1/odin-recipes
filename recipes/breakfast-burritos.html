      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <h4>For the Turkey Sausage</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large bowl add the turkey and all of the seasonings and brown
          sugar. Mix thoroughly to incorporate into the meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large skillet over medium high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and add in
          the turkey. Brown it on both sides and cook it until no pink color
          remains.
        </li>
        <li>
          Break up the sausage into small pieces and set aside until you are
          ready for it later.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>For the Burrito Filling</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          While the turkey is cooking, wash and prep all of your vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the peppers and onion into a small dice and roughly chop the
          spinach into smaller pieces. Measure out 2 cups of frozen shredded
          hash browns.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large skillet over medium high heat add 1 tbsp of oil and add in
          the peppers and onions. Allow them to cook down and soften. Season
          lightly with salt early to help encourage some of the water to be
          released faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the onions have begun to turn translucent, add in the hash browns
          and spinach. Stir to combine and wilt the spinach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Crack 8 eggs into a bowl, add in 2 tbsp of milk and beat until they
          are smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can cook the eggs in the same skillet or in a separate one at the
          same time as the vegetables cook. If you use the same skillet, create
          some room in the center to cook the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in 1 tbsp of oil and pour the eggs into the center to make
          scrambled eggs. Cook them for a few minutes until they have finished.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once done, remove from the heat and stir in the sausage. Mix and give
          it a taste test. Adjust flavor with salt and pepper as necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the mixture to cool before you construct the burritos, put it in
          the fridge for a few minutes if necessary.
        </li>
      </ol>
